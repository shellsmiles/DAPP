    "Understanding which variables have a relationship with your dependent variable is the first step. The next step is to better understand what is influencing that relationship, or the variance seen in your dependent variable. <B>Variance</B> describes the variation in values for a specific variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that some people are taller than others - not everyone is exactly the same height. If we were to ask 100 people their specific height - we would not receive 100 identical answers; instead, we would likely receive different values (with some overlap). This variation in values is variance. When variance is observed, the next step is to determine what the factors are between the variance - in other words, what factors are responsible for the difference in height between the 100 people? Gender is likely an important consideration - as males tend to be taller on average. But is that the only reason some people are taller or shorter than others? Maybe ethnicity is influencing this variance - some ethnic groups are naturally taller than others. Genetics might also contribute; as taller parents typically have taller children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender, ethnicity, genetics, etc - are all factors that may contribute to the variation in height. In this example, these factors are independent variables and the height of the individual is the dependent variable. The key question is: <b>how do changes in the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable?</b> An additional question is: <b>how much of the variation in the dependent variable can be attributed to each independent variable?</b>\n",

    "我们知道有些人比其他人高 - 不是每个人都是完全相同的身高。如果我们要问100个人他们的具体身高 - 我们不会得到100个相同的答案;相反，我们可能会收到不同的值（有一些重叠）。值的这种变化就是方差。当观察到方差时，下一步是确定方差之间的因素是什么 - 换句话说，哪些因素是造成100人之间身高差异的原因？性别可能是一个重要的考虑因素 - 因为男性平均而言往往更高。但这是有些人比其他人高或矮的唯一原因吗？也许种族正在影响这种差异 - 一些种族群体天生比其他种族更高。遗传学也可能有所帮助;因为身高较高的父母通常有较高的孩子。\n",
    "性别，种族，遗传等 - 都是可能导致身高变化的因素。在此示例中，这些因子是自变量，个体的高度是因变量。关键问题是：自变量的变化如何解释因变量的方差？另一个问题是：因变量中有多少变异可以归因于每个自变量？\n",

    "## Things to Consider when using Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we get a sense of the relationship between our variables, we need to make some decisions on which variables to include in our regression analyses.\n",
    "一旦我们了解了变量之间的关系，我们就需要做出一些决定，决定在回归分析中包括哪些变量 \n",
    "<b>We only want to include the variables that have some kind of relationship with your dependent variable(s) of interest.\n",
    "我们只想包含与感兴趣的因变量有某种关系的变量。\n",
    "</b> This allows us to cut back on the empty \"noise\" in your dataset and focus on the variables that are meaningful. \n",
    "这使我们能够减少数据集中的空白\"噪音\"，并专注于有意义的变量。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redundancy冗余\n",
    "Be careful with including multiple variables that show similar information. For example, if you have a variable \"Hours of Study\" which represents the total hours that a student studied, and you've also binned that data and created a new variable \"Study Level\" which groups students into \"high, med, low\" - you now have two variables in your dataset that show similar information, although one variable is a lot more specific. When you have this situation, you should elect to keep the variable that has the more detailed information (i.e. the specific hours of study). \n",
    "在包含显示类似信息的多个变量时要小心。例如，如果您有一个变量\"学习小时数\"，它表示学生学习的总小时数，并且您还对该数据进行了装箱并创建了一个新变量\"学习水平\"，该变量将学生分组为\"高,中，低\" - 您现在在数据集中有两个变量显示类似的信息，尽管一个变量更具体。当您遇到这种情况时，您应该选择保留具有更详细信息（即特定学习时间）的变量。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Groups\n",
    "Variables with a lot of different levels (i.e. State of Residence) don't do well in regression models. If you have a variable that has a large number of different groups, unless this variable is vital to your analyses, you should work to reduce the number of overall groups (i.e State can become Region), or leave the variable out of the analyses. It is possible to include these complicated variables, but it isn't always the easiest interpretation.\n",
    "具有许多不同级别（即居住地）的变量在回归模型中表现不佳。如果变量包含大量不同的组，除非此变量对您的分析至关重要，否则应努力减少总体组的数量（即状态可以成为区域），或者将变量排除在分析之外。可以包含这些复杂的变量，但它并不总是最简单的解释。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confounding Variables混杂变量\n",
    "When we preform regression analyses, we are interested in further understanding the relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Simply put, we are interested in investigating how the independent variable effects the dependent variable. However, it's rarely this simple and there are other factors that need to be understood and controlled. A confounding variable is a third variable that influences both the independent and dependent variable to some degree. It is important to acknowledge this third variable to ensure that the results of your analyses are valid. 当我们进行预制回归分析时，我们感兴趣的是进一步了解因变量和自变量之间的关系。简而言之，我们感兴趣的是研究自变量如何影响因变量。然而，它很少这么简单，还有其他因素需要理解和控制。混杂变量是在一定程度上影响自变量和因变量的第三个变量。确认这第三个变量以确保分析结果有效非常重要。\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you collect data on sunburns and ice cream consumption. You find that higher ice cream consumption is associated with a higher rate of sunburns. Does this mean that eating ice cream causes sunburns? Absolutely not, there are several other factors that can be attributed to this trend -- but most likely, the confounding variable is temperature. Hot temperatures cause people to eat more ice cream and result in people spending more time outdoors, which can result in more sunburns. Without accounting for the confounding variable(s), you may find relationships between variables that might not actually exist. To control for the potential effects of confounding variables, you simply have to include them in your regression model as another independent variable. 例如，您收集有关晒伤和冰淇淋消费的数据。您发现较高的冰淇淋消费量与较高的晒伤率有关。这是否意味着吃冰淇淋会导致晒伤？绝对不是，还有其他几个因素可以归因于这种趋势 - 但最有可能的是，混淆变量是温度。炎热的温度导致人们吃更多的冰淇淋，导致人们在户外花费更多的时间，这可能导致更多的晒伤。如果不考虑混杂变量，您可能会发现变量之间的关系实际上可能并不存在。要控制混杂变量的潜在影响，只需将它们作为另一个自变量包含在回归模型中即可。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you include all of your assumed confounding variables in your regression model, you are controlling for the effects of all of them, and if you find there is still a relationship between a specific independent variable and your dependent variable, you will know that relationship isn't being influenced by any of these other factors.当您在回归模型中包含所有假定的混杂变量时，您正在控制所有这些变量的效果，如果您发现特定自变量与因变量之间仍然存在关系，您将知道该关系不受任何其他因素的影响。\n",

    "\n",
    "But what does that mean non-graphically? Linear regression may not always be the right technique to use for the specific set of data. The fit of the model describes how well your variables explain the variance in the dependent variable. \n",
    "但这在非图形上意味着什么呢？线性回归可能并不总是用于特定数据集的正确技术。模型的拟合描述了变量对因变量方差的解释程度。\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the model fit, we look at the adjusted R-squared (Adj. R-squared). The Adj. R-squared is a statistical measure of how closely the data are to the fitted regression line. <B>The Adj. R-squared is the percentage of variation in the dependent variable that can be explained by all the independent variables included in the model.</B> For example, how much of the variation in student grades (i.e. grades ranging from 32-100) can be explained by hours of study, age, hours of exercise, gender, etc? Values range from 0 to 1; the higher the value, the better the fit. \n",
    "为了评估模型拟合，我们查看调整后的 R 平方（调整 R 平方）。调整 R 平方是数据与拟合回归线的接近程度的统计度量。&lt;B&gt;调整 R 平方是因变量中的变化百分比，可以用模型中包含的所有自变量来解释 &lt;/B&gt;。例如，学生成绩（即32-100）的差异有多少可以通过学习时间，年龄，运动时间，性别等来解释？值范围从 0 到 1;值越高，拟合度越好。\n",

    "### Intercept\n",
    "***\n",
    "The y-intercept, or constant, is the value given to the dependent variable if all independent variables are equal to 0. For example, when all independent variables are equal to 0, the expected student grade is approximately 58. Don't worry too much about this interpretation, oftentimes this won't make sense - for example, if age equals 0, but it's important to know how to review this. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Coefficients (coef)\n",
    "***\n",
    "These values show how changes in the independent variable influence the dependent variable, and in what direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b> Interpreting Numeric Variable Coefficients </b>\n",
    "When you are looking at numeric variables (i.e. age), each coefficient represents the numeric change in the dependent variable given a one-unit change in the independent variable. For example, for every one hour increase in study time (hours), grade increases by 1.9 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>INTERCEPT</b>: when all other IV's are zero, expected grade is around 58\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>AGE</b>: for every one year increase in age, grade increases by 0.04 points (when controlling for hours of study, exercise, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>EXERCISE</b>: for every one hour increase in exercise, grade increases by approximately 1 point (when controlling for age, hours of study, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>HOURS</b>: for every one hour increase in study time, grade increases by 1.9 points (when controlling for age, hours of exercise, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a variable that gives you a negative coefficient, the relationship moves in opposite directions. For example, say the coefficient for age was <b>- 0.0405</b>, you would interpret it in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>AGE</b>: for every one year increase in age, grade <u>decreases</u> by 0.04 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b> Interpreting Categorical Variable Coefficients </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with categorical variables, the model will automatically take one of the categories and use it as a reference (i.e. comparison category). This reference category will not show up in the listed coefficients, and that is how you will be able to identify which category is serving as the reference. In our model, gender is the only categorical variable, and can be interpreted: \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>GENDER</b>:\n",
    "* Female is the reference category\n",
    "* On average, Male students have a grade 0.44 points lower than Female students (when controlling for age, hours of study, and exercise) \n",
    "\n",
    "The grade is lower because the coefficient is negative in this model. If we have more than 2 categories for our categorical variable, we would still compare each level to the reference. For example, if we had a group of students who choose not to disclose their gender, the coefficient for the 'undisclosed' group would show up in our model with it's own coefficient and we would compare those results to the Female category. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Error (std err)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error reflects the level of accuracy of the coefficients. The lower the value, the higher the level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Statistical Significance \n",
    "***\n",
    "#### p-value (P>|t|)\n",
    "When trying to determine if the results we received are statistically important - we need to consider the p-value. The p-value is the probability that you will receive the same results solely by chance (aka there is no meaning behind the results). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the p-value is representing the probability of random findings, we always want to minimize this value. If the p-value was .5 (50%), that would mean that 50% of the time the results we see are just by chance. The p-value reflects how confident we are in our results and requires strict interpretation. A commonly used cut-off is 0.05 (5% chance the results observed are by chance) or below. \n",
    "* If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, we can deem our results to be statistically significant. \n",
    "* If the p-value is greater than 0.05, our results are not statistically significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### What do I do with non-significant variables?\n",
    "***\n",
    "Regression analyses are rarely a \"one and done\" situation. After you run your analyses, you should tweak your model (equation) and see if you can improve the model fit. A good place to start is by removing non-significant variables from our model. In this example, gender and age are not significant - let's try a model without them!"
